# AVHYAS Version-1

About
Advanced Hyperspectral Data Analysis (AVHYAS) plugin is a Python-3 based QGIS-plugin designed to process and analyse hyperspectral (Hx) images. Starting with the version 1.0, AVHYAS serves as a free and open-source platform for sharing and distributing algorithms and methods among scientists and potential end-users. It is developed to guarantee full usage of future hyperspetcral missions of Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and other space agencies and providing access to advanced algorithms for Hx data processing. The software is freely available and offers a range of tools and applications for the atmospheric correction of airborne AVIRIS-NG image, classical processing tools for Hx data as well as powerful machine learning and Deep Learning interfaces for the interdisciplinary users. This paper gives an overview of the AVHYAS plugin for users, explains typical workflows and use cases for making it a constantly used platform for hyperspectral remote sensing applications.
